MPG Regression

    Using the data provided (MechaCar_mpg.csv) I have run a multiple linear regression on mpg against all other variables to test the whether or not they have a significant impact on the vehicles MPG performance.

Call:
lm(formula = mpg ~ vehicle.length + vehicle.weight + spoiler.angle + 
    ground.clearance + AWD, data = MechaCar)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-19.4701  -4.4994  -0.0692   5.4433  18.5849 

Coefficients:
                   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)      -1.040e+02  1.585e+01  -6.559 5.08e-08 ***
vehicle.length    6.267e+00  6.553e-01   9.563 2.60e-12 ***
vehicle.weight    1.245e-03  6.890e-04   1.807   0.0776 .  
spoiler.angle     6.877e-02  6.653e-02   1.034   0.3069    
ground.clearance  3.546e+00  5.412e-01   6.551 5.21e-08 ***
AWD              -3.411e+00  2.535e+00  -1.346   0.1852

Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 5.35e-11

    The analysis shows that Intercept, vehicle.length and ground.clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values, which can be seen via the p-values. 
All other variables do not have a statistically significant impact.  The slopes of the statistically significant variables, vehicle.length(p-value: 2.60e-12) and ground.clearance(p-value: 5.21e-08), are 6.267 and 3.546 respectively, so the slope of the model is not considered to be zero. Additionally, the R-squared value of 0.6825 shows that about 70% of the variance is explained by this model. As a result, I can conclude that this model effectively predicts the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes.



Suspension Coil Summary

lot 1 variance: 1.15
lot 2 variance: 10.13
lot 3 variance: 220.10
all lots variance: 76.2

	The above data shows that the overall variance for the suspension coils does not exceed the specified 100 psi. However, lot 3 is producing sub-standard suspension coils with a variance of 220.10 psi.



Suspension Coil t-test

	The one sample t-test revealed that the suspension coil's pound-per-inch results are not statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch. This can be determined from the p-value of 0.512, which means we must except the null hypothesis.


Design Your Own Study

	For a future study I would look at how MechaCar's reliability stacks up against the competition. With so much technology in modern vehicles, servicing and repairs are growing to be ever-more expensive. A car that is reliable will reduce running costs, and allow consumers to keep the same vehicle longer.
	The study would ask the question of whether or not MechaCar's are statistically more reliable than the competition. The Null-Hypothesis would be that MechaCar's are not more reliable than the competition, and the Alternate-Hypothesis would be the opposite.
	The data that should be collected for this study would be a historical look at service costs for MechaCars and the competitors to be used for a multiple linear regression.
